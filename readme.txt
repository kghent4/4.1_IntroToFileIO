4.1 Instructions: Create a Java program that will ask the user for a name.
                Search Bathroomlog.txt to determine how many times that student
                went to the bathroom, according to Bathroomlog.txt. Print the result. Assume that
                if the user is searching for a name that exists in the bathroom log,
                they will type it in as it appears in Bathroomlog.txt.

                IMPORTANT: Do not modify Bathroomlog.txt. Do not hard code the number of
                times you scan based on the number of names in the file. Your code should work
                with any .txt file I provide that is in the same format.

                Commit but don't submit! We'll use this one for tomorrow's assignment
                as well.


4.2 Instructions: Modify your program from 4.1 to work with BathroomlogPLUS.txt,
                which contains the same data as Bathroomlog.txt but with some
                added formatting. Files you read in the real world will more likely
                look like this than Bathroomlog.txt. 

                Challenge: Have your program print the total number of minutes that
                the given student was in the bathroom, according to BathroomlogPLUS.txt.

                Challenge: Display all given information in a tabular format.
